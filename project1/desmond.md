## Review

#### Project Purpose

Desmond created a two-player quiz to test players on their knowledge of Singapore. Each player gets to answer 5 random questions. The player with highest point wins.

#### Project Organization

#### Features

* Points system
  * Points are given to each player upon correct answers.  
* Buttons
  * Players select their answers with true and false buttons. If answer is correct, points will be added for the corresponding player. Replay button allows players to play the game again with another randomly generated set of questions.

#### Areas of Job-well-done

* Organization
  * Very neat and well organized codes.
* Code
  * Given names are clear, easy to read and to understand.
* Constructor Object
  * Suitable use of constructor objects. Looks like the objects helped keep codes organized!

#### Areas for Improvement

* Unused marking
  * line 51: is that an unused '}'?
* Suggestion
  * How about adding a little note at the end of each answers to provide related information? Can also consider displaying a big and obvious word saying "CORRECT" or "WRONG".

## Additional Notes

Congratulations on completing project 1!
