## Review

#### Project Purpose

The purpose of the project is to create a game to help the farmer get rid of the crop destroying moles! Whack the mole by hitting on the corresponding letters on your keyboard!

#### Project Organization

#### Features

* Hit the letter displayed with the mole
  * A user has an input letter to type whenever a mole pops out. The mole comes out for a limited time with a letter and if you hit it within the interval, you will be able to score a point.
  * The logic was implemented by create a function with the use of 'keypress'. The usage of the setTimeOut allows the game to be kept within a specified time!

#### Areas of Success (Code, Creativity)

* Variables are named very well
  * All variables are defined at the start and is simple to read and understand!
* Creativity in the game
  * The standard whack-a-mole game was to use the mouse but you were able to think creatively to tweak the game whereby you use letters instead!

#### Areas for Improvement (Code, Organization)

* Declaring variables
  * Instead of declaring global variable, maybe you could declare variables in the function to prevent pollution.


## Additional Notes

Good job! :)
